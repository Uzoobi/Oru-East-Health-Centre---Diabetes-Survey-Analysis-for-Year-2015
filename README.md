# Oru-East-Health-Centre---Diabetes-Survey-Analysis-for-Year-2015
Project Summary 

The diabetes survey conducted by Oru-East Health Centre in 2015 aimed to analyze the prevalence and characteristics of diabetes among different demographic groups in the surveyed population. By examining factors such as age, BMI, skin thickness, glucose levels, number of pregnancies, and diabetes pedigree function (DPF), this study provides insights into the key contributors to diabetes in this community. The analysis identifies high-risk groups and correlations between various health metrics and diabetes outcomes. 

Key Skills: 

Data Analysis: Using data visualization to interpret health metrics and diabetes prevalence.
Health Risk Assessment: Identifying demographic groups at high risk for diabetes.
Statistical Insight: Analyzing patterns in glucose levels, BMI, and other metrics to uncover diabetes risk factors.
Public Health Strategy: Offering recommendations based on survey outcomes to improve community health.

Methodology

Data Collection: Gathered health metrics from survey participants, including age, BMI, skin thickness, glucose levels, pregnancy history, and DPF scores.
Visualization: Created dashboard charts and graphs to show correlations between various health metrics and diabetes outcomes.
Trend Analysis: Analyzed patterns in the dataset to determine age groups, BMI ranges, and glucose levels associated with the highest diabetes incidence.
Risk Factor Identification: Compared diabetes vs. non-diabetes cases across different demographic and health metrics to identify risk factors.

Outcome Summary: 
Summarized findings in terms of high-risk demographics, key metrics influencing diabetes prevalence, and potential areas for health interventions.

Observations
Overall Outcome:
34% of the participants were diagnosed with diabetes, while 66% were non-diabetic.

Age Distribution:
The age group with the highest number of diabetes cases is 41-45 years, with a notable drop in cases for participants above 55 years.
Age ranges 26-35 and 41-50 show relatively high diabetes outcomes, suggesting that middle-aged adults are at a higher risk.

BMI and Diabetes:
The 30-35 BMI range correlates with the highest diabetes outcomes, indicating that individuals in the overweight category are at greater risk.
Lower and higher BMI ranges see fewer diabetes cases, possibly indicating that extreme weight (underweight or very high BMI) is less common in this population.

Skin Thickness:
Most diabetic outcomes are seen with skin thickness values between 31-33, suggesting a possible link between higher skin thickness and diabetes.

Glucose Levels:
The glucose range 110-119 has the highest recorded diabetes outcomes, suggesting that people with glucose levels in this range are at increased risk.

Pregnancy and Diabetes:
Participants with 0 pregnancies have the most diabetes outcomes, followed by those with 1 pregnancy. This indicates that the number of pregnancies does not necessarily correlate with higher diabetes risk in this dataset.

Diabetes Pedigree Function (DPF):
A DPF range of 0.278-0.378 shows the highest diabetes outcomes, highlighting a potential genetic or hereditary component to diabetes risk.


Recommendations

Targeted Age-Based Interventions:
Focus health education and preventive measures on individuals aged 41-45, as they exhibit the highest diabetes risk. Early screening and lifestyle interventions for this group could be beneficial.

BMI Management Programs:
Introduce programs promoting healthy BMI maintenance, especially for individuals with BMI in the 30-35 range. This could include weight management resources, nutrition counseling, and physical activity programs.

Monitor Glucose Levels:
Establish regular glucose screening for participants with levels in the 110-119 range, as they are at higher risk of developing diabetes. Encouraging dietary changes and regular exercise could help manage glucose levels within a healthy range.

Educational Campaigns on Hereditary Factors:
Provide information on the impact of family history and DPF on diabetes risk. Those with higher DPF scores should be encouraged to participate in regular screenings and adopt healthier lifestyles.

Skin Thickness and Risk Awareness:
Though skin thickness is not a common risk factor, the data suggests that individuals with skin thickness values around 31-33 could have a higher risk. Further studies may be needed to validate this observation, but this could be included in preventive health checks.

Pregnancy and Diabetes Monitoring:
The data shows that participants with no pregnancies have higher diabetes outcomes. Awareness programs could help address potential misconceptions about the correlation between pregnancy history and diabetes.

This analysis serves as a foundation for Oru-East Health Centre to implement targeted health programs, monitor high-risk groups more closely, and improve the overall health of the community.
